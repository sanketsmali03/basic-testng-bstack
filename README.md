## Introduction

TestNG is a testing framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs, from unit testing (testing a class in isolation of the others) to integration testing (testing entire systems made of several classes, several packages and even several external frameworks, such as application servers). 

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a Selenium test framework written in TestNG with parallel testing capabilties. The Selenium test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios, written in Next and React. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Selenium tests are run on different platforms like on-prem, docker and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

## Repository setup

- Clone the repository

- For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise) ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is placed in the `/src/test/resources/` folder.

- Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on the machine
  - Java >= 8
  - Maven >= 3.1+

  Maven:
    ```sh
    mvn install
    ```


- How to run the test?

  To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven (Single Test) :
    ```sh
  mvn clean -P single
  ```

   Maven (Parallel Test) ::
    ```sh 
   mvn clean -P single
  ```
